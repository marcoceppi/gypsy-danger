In order to load the long running model data you need access to the apache
logs for Jujucharm.com and there are two servers there.

Getting the logs

- get the credentials for the swift bucket from enigma (or webops ticket first)
- get the python-swiftclient (apt-get install python-swift)
- source the credential file
- make get-logs
- make _initdb
- make longrunning
